hiiiii um not really sure what to put here so

-this is a kinda basic Hash encoder made in python cause like i didnt wanna do it and javascript and i got flask work to do with it

-the other text files arent wholly integral as long as you change the file names in the code

- im leaving in my files cause its filled with just testing data so go crazy

- for later implementation remove stuff like asking for the username again when decoding, and in test

-also test is the main thing to run however the decoder file is seperate from it
